Problem Statement : 

Suppose there is a circle. There are N petrol pumps on that circle. You will be given two sets of data.<br>
1. The amount of petrol that every petrol pump has.
2. Distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump.<br>

Find a starting point where the truck can start to get through the complete circle without exhausting its petrol in between.<br>
Note :  Assume for 1 litre petrol, the truck can go 1 unit of distance.


### SOlution : 

CODE : 
```
class Solution{
  public:
  
    //Function to find starting point where the truck can start to get through
    //the complete circle without exhausting its petrol in between.
    int tour(petrolPump p[],int n){
       int ans = 0;
       int balance = 0;
       int loss = 0;
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
           balance += p[i].petrol - p[i].distance;
           if(balance < 0){
               loss += balance;
               balance = 0;
               ans = i + 1;
           }
       }
       if(balance + loss >= 0) return ans;
       return -1;
    }
};
