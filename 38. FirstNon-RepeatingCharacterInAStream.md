Problem Link : https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/first-non-repeating-character-in-a-stream1216/1

Problem Statement : 

Given an input stream A of n characters consisting only of lower case alphabets.<br> While reading characters from the stream, you have to tell which character has appeared only once in the stream upto that point.<br> If there are many characters that have appeared only once, you have to tell which one of them was the first one to appear.<br> If there is no such character then append '#' to the answer.

NOTE:
1. You need to find the answer for every i (0 <= i < n)
2. In order to find the solution for every i you need to consider the string from starting position till ith position.

### Solution : 

```
class Solution {
	public:
		string FirstNonRepeating(string s){
		    vector<int> freq(26, 0);
		    queue<char> q;
		    string ans ;
		    for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
		        freq[s[i]-'a']++;
		        if(freq[s[i] -'a'] == 1) q.push(s[i]);
		        
		        while(!q.empty() && freq[q.front()-'a'] > 1){
		            q.pop();
		        }
		        if(q.empty()){
		            ans.push_back('#');
		        }
		        else ans.push_back(q.front());
		    }
		    return ans;
		}

};
